## Usage

```
fstopxmp -j [-T TABS] [-m METHOD] [-w THREADS] [-L MAX_FILE_COUNT] [-i] [-t] [-r] [-f] [FILE]...
Options:
    -j                   JSON output
    -T TABS              Enable JSON pretty output with TABS tabs for each indentation level.

                             1    Get \"tags\" using regex, get \"favorite\" and \"rating\" using \"substr()\"
                             2    Get \"tags\",\"favorite\",\"rating\" using \"substr()\"
                             3    Get \"tags\" using both of \"substr()\" and \"str[pos]\", get \"favorite\" and \"rating\" using \"str[pos]\"
                             (Tested efficiency: 3>2>1)
    -w THREADS           Worker threads, an integer ranging from 1 to 128.
    -L MAX_FILE_COUNT    Limit file count to MAX_FILE_COUNT
    -i                   Read from file list. Treat FILE as newline-seperated file name(s). If \"-\" is given, read from standard input.
    -t, -r, -f:

                         -f    Include favorites
                         If those are not given, Include all of them.
    FILE:
                         1)    If -i is not given, FILE are *.xmp Files, or other files with other suffix but have their *.xmp files.
